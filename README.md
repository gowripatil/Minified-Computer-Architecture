# Minified-Computer-Architecture
An experimental architecture for a simple weather prediction computer called “Minified Computer Architecture (MCA)”

Proposed and implemented an architecture for a simple weather prediction computer called “Minified Computer Architecture (MCA)”. It will be a 16-bit architecture. This will include complete processor, memory and cache architecture for a simple computer used for basic mathematic calculations for integers.

For more details on the architecture refer: Architecture.pdf
